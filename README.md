# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction
This is a python game in terminal. Tic-Tac-Toe's another name is X-O-X.

## How to Play
X always goes first.

Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either (a) one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally; or (b) all nine squares are filled.
